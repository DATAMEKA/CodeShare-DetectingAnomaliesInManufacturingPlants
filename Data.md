  **Dataset** 
============

The dataset consists of 3,300 fan `sounds` captured in a factory, stored in .wav format. Each recording is a 10-second audio clip with a single channel. The accompanying `label.csv `file contains information about the labeling and the split between training, validation, and testing data. Specifically, there are 2573 samples in the training set, 363 samples in the validation set, and 364 samples in the testing set. This dataset has been sourced from the [DCASE](https://dcase.community/challenge2022/task-unsupervised-anomalous-sound-detection-for-machine-condition-monitoring) challenge and subsequently modified.
