The manufacturing sector has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. However, with the increasing number of factories, detecting machine breakdowns and safety risks has become a challenge. The annual cost of unplanned downtime in the manufacturing sector is estimated to be a substantial amount. To address these challenges, factories are exploring machine learning and other technologies for effective anomaly detection. Detecting abnormal events in factory sound is particularly important as it provides valuable insights into machine health and performance. In this challenge, participants will develop machine learning models specifically designed to detect anomalies in factory sound data accurately. By achieving accurate anomaly detection, participants can help improve operational safety and efficiency, reducing downtime and increasing productivity.

"Your objective is ***to create an anomaly factory sound detection model using only the normal factory sound data***. During testing, your anomaly detection model should be able to accurately determine whether a given sound signal is normal or abnormal.

Participants are required to submit a test set results in a CSV file with two columns :  

-   `file_id`: a unique identifier for each observation in the test set.

-   `score`: predicted confidence score of a sound being normal (does not have to be normalized to [0-1]).

Please ensure that the model code must be submitted no later than seven days after the submission deadline.

Evaluation Metric

The performance of the models will be evaluated using AUROC. A higher AUROC score indicates better model performance in correctly identifying anomalous sound.
